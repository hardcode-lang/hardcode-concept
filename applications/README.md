Applications
============

At a top level the ecosystem on top of <b>HardCode</b> programming language is about 2 components:
- [cloud service creation and mangagement platform](service_platform.md) - a concept where the only application a programmer ever needs installed on server is an agent of the service platform
- [next gen browsing platform](browsing_platform.md) - a concept where a next gen browser is the only application user ever requires to be installed at personal computer

Also there's an [analyzable sanboxing](analyzable_sanboxing.md) concept described here for referencing.

And a [quoted scripting](quoted_scripting.md) concept is presented here as the most dramatic analyzable sanboxing application example.
