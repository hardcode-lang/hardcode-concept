Browsing platform
=================

Even at early stages of Web evolution there was a tempting idea to develop everything as Web applications.
This could eliminate the need to download desktop applications at all, eliminate need for explicit OS support and
could even give a way to seamlessly surf across virtual spaces.

Yet even today we don't see any total transgression of top-graphics games, image, video, audio and 3D manipulation tools or
other resource consuming applications to Web.

There are 3 primary reasons for that:
- poor performance and low convenience of JavaScript, WebGL, WebAssembly, Web Storage, WebSocket and other Web technologies
- absence of untrusted code execution mechanism (e. g., it slows down the development of 3D avatar technology and other third party programmatic content)
- general Web surfing paradigm: Web browser still remains an HTML document with scripts viewer 

Those issues are solved by HardCode ecosystem:
- the HardCode general purpose programming language gives no performance penalties and allows for controllable untrusted code execution
- the server platform on top of HardCode and a cluster network protocol in it's foundation introduces adequate network subsystem
- the browsing platform paradigm declaring separating data from presentation solves the rest of the issues
  standing in the way of creation and evolution of global seamless multimedia virtual space
